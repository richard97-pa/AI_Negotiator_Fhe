# AI Negotiator: Your Decentralized Market Liaison ðŸ¤–

AI Negotiator is a revolutionary AI-powered agent designed to negotiate on behalf of users in decentralized markets, leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This innovative solution allows users to set encrypted purchase goals and limits, ensuring that their preferences remain confidential while the AI negotiates on their behalf. Say goodbye to the anxiety of negotiations and hello to seamless, automated market transactions!

## The Problem at Hand

Traditional negotiation processes in decentralized markets can be complex, time-consuming, and often intimidating, especially for everyday users. Individuals wanting to engage in NFT transactions or other trades may feel overwhelmed by the intricacies of market dynamics. Additionally, exposing one's negotiation parameters to the public can lead to unfavorable circumstances, such as price manipulation or counteroffers that go beyond one's budget. These challenges can result in missed opportunities and subpar transactions, deterring many potential users from actively participating in decentralized markets.

## The FHE Solution

By employing **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, AI Negotiator addresses these pain points head-on. FHE allows sensitive negotiation strategies to be encrypted, ensuring that the AI can operate without revealing the userâ€™s intentions or threshold limits. This is implemented using Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**. Encrypting user-defined parameters transforms negotiations into a private, secure process, promoting confidence while interacting in decentralized markets. With a simple command, users can set their ideal outcomes and let the AI handle the rest!

## Key Features

- **Encrypted Negotiation Strategies**: Users can input their negotiation targets and limits through FHE, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential.
- **AI-Powered Decision Making**: The AI agent employs sophisticated algorithms to negotiate the best possible outcomes on behalf of the user.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Users no longer need to handle negotiations directly; the AI acts as a dedicated representative in the marketplace.
- **Comprehensive Negotiation Logs**: Users can access detailed logs of the negotiation process to analyze performance and outcomes.
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work across various decentralized exchanges and NFT marketplaces, making it versatile for all user needs.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The primary engine for confidential computing, utilizing the security of Fully Homomorphic Encryption.
- **Node.js**: Required for running the backend and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: For compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts efficiently.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts.
